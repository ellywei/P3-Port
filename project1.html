            <h3>Project Intro</h3>
            <p>  
            The Hales Branding Book is a branding package created for a branding design project in a course of Fraser International College- Graphic Design. The package is built based on an imaginary company- Hales, whose main business is producing and selling diving equipment. A set of branding design of the company was included, such as the logo, letterhead, and business card.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>  
            During the first 2 weeks, we were asked to brainstorm and think about the "company" that we would like to design for and what is the style of branding should be in order to match with the "company". At this stage, my partner and I did research online on precedents, and then we did sketches on paper, finally settled down on a solution for the logo on Adobe Illustrator. The next two weeks, based on the "company" we created, different variations of the logo and other branding products like the letterhead and the business card were created, too. New to Illustrator, we watched many online tutorials to be familiar with different tools and effects in Illustrator.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>  
            The purpose of this assignment is to get an overall idea about the process of creating a commercial branding package, including a presentation of the products- a branding book. Plus, it is also a perfect time for design beginners to be familiar with and to learn practical skills about Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.â€‹After finished the project, I gained a solid foundation of practice in making visual branding package, and the ability to create and alter graphical content on Illustrator and Photoshop. If to improve the package, I would try to investigate more branding package cases in the business and try to see what could be changed and what could be added to make the project better.
