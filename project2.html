            <h3>Project Intro</h3>
            <p>           
            The Cinephile magazine is an imaginary product that provides guides and reviews for films and TV series. The project is made for Fraser International College’s graphic design course. It contains the designing of a cover page and two spreads of the magazine, it requires graphic designing, layout designing, font and color palette selecting.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>  
            Similar to the Hales Branding Book design, in this project, the first thing to do is to research, both on the layout design and the different type of magazines. After the research, I started to sketch out drafts for possible layout, which is the most difficult part of the design process.

            <img src="img/Cinephile font2.png" alt="Cinephile font2 pic"></a>      

            <div Class="projectSpacing2">
            <p>  
            At first, I find it hard to connect the pages in a way that allows the readers’ eyes to flow through. Thus I did more researching on the TV series I choose, noticed that the show uses a lot of ‘8’ shapes in their posters, so I took use of the '8' shape and embedded it as graphic elements on the magazine spreads to match with the show, at the same time creating a visual navigation based on it.

            <div>

            <div Class="projectSpacing2">
            <p>  
            In the last stage, the fonts and the pictures used were designed, and during this process, I learn a lot about how to use typeface in the design. The layout was put together in Adobe InDesign because the software is better for dealing with texts. All the pictures were altered in Photoshop, adjusted the exposure, color, and texture in order have a style which is consistent with the magazine.  Also, some geometric graphic elements were created in Illustrator to create reading flows, such as the '8' shape.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>  
            Acquired basic knowledge about techniques of creating text-image combined content and practice of making the print version of it, gained experience in using InDesign, also learned designing graphic content combining different Adobe software. I think more could be done to improve the images quality in the design, especially the cover page image,  it should be modified in ways that it matches the style with the spreads, such as applying a filter.
